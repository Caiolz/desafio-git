        For What It's Worth
        There's somethin' happenin' here
        What it is ain't exactly clear
        There's a man with a gun over there
        A-tellin' me I've got to beware
        
        I think it's time we stop
        Children, what's that sound?
        Everybody look what's goin' down
        
        There's battle lines bein' drawn
        Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
        Young people speakin' their minds
        A-gettin' so much resistance from behind
        
        I think it's time we stop
        Hey, what's that sound?
        Everybody look what's goin' down
        
        What a field day for the heat
        A thousand people in the street
        Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs
        Mostly sayin' hooray for our side
        
        It's time we stop
        Hey, what's that sound?
        Everybody look what's goin' down
        
        Paranoia strikes deep
        Into your life it will creep
        It starts when you're always afraid
        Step out of line, the men come and take you away
        
        You better stop
        Hey, what's that sound?
        Everybody look what's goin'
        You better stop
        Hey, what's that sound?
        Everybody look what's goin'
        You better stop
        Now, what's that sound?
        Everybody look what's goin'
        You better stop
        Children, what's that sound?
        Everybody look what's goin
